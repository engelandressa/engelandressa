## Hi I'm Andressa!

I'm a Brazilian Graphic Designer with almost 4 years of experience. Currently, I'm transitioning into the tech field, combining my background in visual design with new skills in UI/UX and software development. Iâ€™ve recently started a degree in Multipataform Software Development at Fatec, and I am actively looking for an internship to apply and grow my skills in a professional environment.
